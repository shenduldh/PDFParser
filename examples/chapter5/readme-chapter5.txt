Chapter 5: Graphics
===================

These are the files used to create the figures in Chapter 5. They are
uncompressed, so the graphics streams may be read in a text editor.


graphics-line.pdf uses the m, l and S operators to draw a straight line.

building-lines.pdf uses the w operator to change line width and the d operator
to change the dash pattern.

bezier-curve.pdf uses the c operator to draw a curve.

filled-shape.pdf uses the c, y and h operators to build a closed shape, and the
B operator to fill and stroke it.

winding-rules.pdf demonstrates the difference between even-odd and non-zero
winding rules for self-intersecting shapes.

colors.pdf uses the g and re operators to draw grayscale blocks.

stacks.pdf demonstrates how the q and Q operators may be used to isolate the
effects of state-altering operators.

transforms.pdf uses the cm operator to alter the scale, position and rotation
of a path.

path-clipping.pdf uses the W operator to create a clipping path.

transparency.pdf demonstrates how the gs operator can be used to load external
graphics state (in this case, transparency).

pattern-shading.pdf shows how pattern and shading dictionaries can be used to
draw an axial graident shading pattern.

pattern-shading-2.pdf is the same, but for a radial shading.

form-xobjects.pdf shows how to use a Form XObject to allow for the re-use of
graphical content witthout repetition.

image-xobject.pdf defines a one bit-per-pixel image and draws it at different
scales.
